    <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, whisk together flour, granulated sugar, nutmeg, and salt by hand. Add eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla, and beat at medium-low speed until smooth. Add ½ cup (113 grams) butter, beating to combine. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Place remaining ¼ cup (57 grams) butter in prepared pan. Place pan in oven until butter is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle brown sugar over melted butter. Top with peaches, arranging as desired in a single layer. Spoon batter over peaches, smoothing top with an offset spatula.</li>
    <li>Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes, covering with foil after 30 minutes of baking to prevent excess browning. Run a knife around edges of pan to loosen cake. Invert cake onto a serving plate, and let cool slightly. Serve warm.</li>
