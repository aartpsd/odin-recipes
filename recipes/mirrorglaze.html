        <h2>Mirror Glaze</h2>
        <p class="description">This mirror glaze recipe is from the blog "ChelSweets". It's a creative and gorgeous way to create a background on a cake. You'll need gelatin, sugar, milk, chocolate and water to create this masterpiece.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>7 grams of unflavored gelatin, bloomed in 50 grams of water</li>
                <li>300 grams of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>180 grams of room temperature water</li>
                <li>170 grams of sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>350 grams of choclate chips</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Materials</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>food scale</li>
                <li>digital thermometer</li>
                <li>powder food coloring</li>
                <li>microwave</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by mixing 1 envelope of about 2 1/2 tsp gelatin in a bowl with 1/4 cup of water. Set aside to let it bloom while you begin the glaze.</li>
                <li>Pour sugar, water, and sweetened condensed milk in a heatproof bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat for 90 seconds on high power in the microwave.</li>
                <li>Remove the mixture and stir the mixture. Pour in the bloomed gelatin, and whisk until the gelatin is fully dissolved.</li>
                <li>Melt the white chocolate chips in microwave by heating it in 30 second intervals, stirring between each interval. Once the white chocolate is fully melted, pour the chocolate into the warm gelatin mixture.</li>
                <li>Carefully whisk mixture until fully combined. Pour through a sieve to remove any chunks of unmelted chocolate or stubborn bits of gelatin.</li>
                <li>Continue to stir occasionally (to prevent a skin from forming), until the glaze has reached 90 degrees, or is just slightly warm to the touch.</li>
                <li>Divide the glaze evenly between four bowls. Color them different shades using gel food coloring. To create this galaxy mirror glaze, color them blue, purple, black, and pink.</li>
                <li>Pour each color of glaze back into one large bowl, alternating colors and drizzling the colors together as you pour them.</li>
                <li>Place a chilled buttercream cake (in the freezer at least 10 minutes or the fridge for 1 hour) on top of a circular object smaller than the cake board, and set this on top of large baking sheet to catch the run-off glaze.</li>
